# Thalamus

The thalamus sits near the center of the brain between the cerebral cortex and the midbrain.
The thalamus receives input from virtually all areas of the [[cerebral cortex]] in primary sensory areas of the brain. It also receives nonsensory input from areas critical to motor control and emotion, the [[basal ganglia]], [[the cerebellum]] and the [[limbic system]].  
the thalamus projects widely back to the cerebral cortex and to subcortical structures in reciprocal loops. These highly extensive connections are why the thalamus is often referred to as the gateway of the cortex.  
Primarily, it acts as a relay station between incoming signals from the sense organs in subcortical areas, to the cerebral cortex, and back again.  
Functionally, the thalamus can best be described as an information hub. It allows for top down regulation of processes involved in sleep, attention and consciousness, and bottom up transmission of information the cerebral cortex needs to guide those processes.  
Every sensory system, with the sole exception of the olfactory system, sends its input to cortex through a specific thalamic nucleus, a group of cell bodies.
