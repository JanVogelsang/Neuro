# Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is found in all vertebrate brains. In humans, it is about the size of a small grape and sits just below the thalamus and above the brainstem.  
It plays a central role in coordinating the body's autonomic response to information conveyed through limbic structures, like the amygdala, and higher structures, like cortex.  
Its many small nuclei take in information about the levels of different vital factors in the body, like heart rate, plasma-sodium concentration and temperature. These nuclei then compare the measured levels to an optimal set point for physiological function.  
If levels are too far from the set point, the hypothalamus motivates corrective behavior to restore them.  
The hypothalamus's central role is the maintenance of internal homeostasis, a steady state of equilibrium and physiological constancy. When homeostasis is threatened, the hypothalamus mounts a three-pronged response, engaging the autonomic nervous system, the endocrine system and the behavioral system.  
It sends commands to the brainstem and the spinal cord that activate autonomic preganglionic neurons to mount a fight or flight, or rest and digest response.  
It also activates the basal ganglia and the cortex and controls hormone release via a structure called the pituitary gland.
