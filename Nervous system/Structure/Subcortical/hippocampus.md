# Hippocampus

Declarative memories, the recall of stored facts and experiences, are thought to be subserved by another subcortical structure, the hippocampus. Your two hippocampi sit on either side of the thalamus just below the amygdalae.  
The hippocampus is reciprocally connected to both the cortex and subcortical structures. Activity in the hippocampus is necessary for converting short-term memories into long-term memories.  
How the hippocampus uses this context to consolidate memories though is still largely unknown. However, it seems to involve long term potentiation. Specifically, long term potentiation may allow the hippocampus to preferentially strengthen certain patterns of neuronal firing, and these patterns may encode those memories.
Interestingly, the hippocampus' plasticity, or its ability to change its strength of his neuronal connections, may also extend beyond LTP. The hippocampus is one of only two regions where neurogenesis, the birth and migration of new neurons, has been found to occur in the adult brain.

## Spatial navigation

Cells in the hippocampus, and also in neighboring entorhinal cortex, constitute a sort of positioning system in the brain. These cells appear to create a dynamic map of the environment that shifts as we move from place to place, and encodes our specific location at all times. The spatial navigation system is an area of ongoing research. Studies in rats have shown that between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, the brain forms a sort of topographic map. Neurons, in the region of the map corresponding to a particular place in the environment, fire as rats move through that particular place.
