# Midbrain

Sitting at the center of the brain, the midbrain, also known as the mesencephalon, is located above the hindbrain, below the forebrain.

## Tectum

The tectum makes up the top part of the midbrain and it controls the auditory and visual reflexes.
In humans, the tectum consists entirely of four small bumps, the colliculi, which come in two stacked pairs: The inferior and the superior colliculi.
The superior colliculi, the uppermost part, are devoted to vision. They receive inputs both directly from the retina and from V1,
and control an array of visual reflexes, especially those involved in tracking objects moving through the visual field. They exert this control by stimulating ocular motor neurons. The motor movements of the eyes can be initiated voluntarily but they also occur reflexively. This adaptive automatic orienting allows you to continuously adjust to changes in your visual field.
The inferior colliculi are involved in auditory processing. Like the superior colliculi, the inferior colliculi modulate sensory orientation in a basic, reflexive manner. They control, for example, the startle response. The reflexive responses that the midbrain generates allow for adaptive, evolutionarily crucial reactions that the cortex is far too slow to carry out.

## Tegmentum

The tegmentum is an area within the cerebral peduncles which is involved not only in transmitting commands for voluntary movement but also in producing them. It is a network of neurons involved in the control of simple body movements and various reflexive and homeostatic circuits.
Nuclei in the tegmentum project directly to the basal ganglium, a cluster of neurons just above the midbrain that are key to the production of certain types of behavior. Behaviors driven by evolutionarily conserved motivations as well as habitual automatized behavioral patterns.
One specific midbrain nucleus, called the substantia nigra, is very closely tied to the basal ganglia and motor function. It is recognizable on brain scans as a darkly pigmented area. This is due to the many clustered dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. These neurons synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine. They also contain high levels of melanin, the pigment which gives the substantia nigra its classically dark appearance.
Dopaminergic activity in the substantia nigra appears to be key for basal ganglionic function. And dopaminergic neurons project directly to the basal ganglia where they cause secondary motor activation.
