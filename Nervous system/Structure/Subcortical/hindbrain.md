# Hindbrain

The hindbrain is a collection of structures that are responsible for many of our autonomic functions. It consists of the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain) and the cerebellum and controls essential functions like breathing, coughing and heart rate.

## Medulla
The medulla is located at the very base of the brain, just where the spinal cord enters the skull. It's bordered on a superior, or top edge, by the pons. And it sends fibers directly down into the spinal cord.
The medulla connects the higher levels of the brain to the spinal cord, and allows for maintenance of posture and basic protective motor reflexes, like those that cause vomiting, coughing, sneezing, and swallowing.
In addition, it's responsible for a variety of autonomic nervous system functions. It's responsible for the regulation of breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion, which it modulates through interaction with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.
For example, pressure receptors in the medulla mediate vasomotor reflexes to adjust the widening and tightening of our blood vessels, while chemoreceptors regulate respiratory function by detecting the change in pH in our blood, signaling the lungs to adjust breathing and oxygenation rate when they climb too high or fall too low. The medulla carries out these functions in an autonomous fashion unconsciously.

## Pons
Just on top of the medulla sits the pons, which serves as a bridge to the midbrain.
The pons is a key relay station, bridging the gap between the medulla, cortex, and the cerebellum. Thick bundles of nerve fibers run through the pons, conducting nerve signals from the brain down to the cerebellum and medulla.
The pons also contains several nuclei with functions comparable to those of the medulla and the midbrain. The pontine nuclei are involved in regulation of sleep, respiration and swallowing, chewing, bladder control, some eye movements, facial expressions, and upright posture.
