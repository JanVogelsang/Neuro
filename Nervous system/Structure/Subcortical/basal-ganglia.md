# Basal Ganglia

The basal ganglia provide modulatory guidance for movement and learning. The basal ganglia is commonly referred to as a singular entity, but is in reality a collection of structures, including the striatum, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra. These areas are critical for movement, learning, and other tasks related to behavioral control.
