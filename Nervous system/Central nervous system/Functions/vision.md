# Vision

Visual information is recorded by the retina in the eye. From there is gets send over the optic nerve to the thalamus where inputs are sorted and begin to be processes. From there it is send to the visual cortex at the back of the brain where features are extracted from the visual scene such as shape, color, object identity, distance, motion, etc.
