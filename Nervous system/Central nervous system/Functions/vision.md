# Vision

Visual information is recorded by the retina in the eye. From there is gets send over the optic nerve to the thalamus where inputs are sorted and begin to be processes. From there it is send to the visual cortex at the back of the brain where features are extracted from the visual scene such as shape, color, object identity, distance, motion, etc.

## Receptors
There are two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones. Rods get activated in the dark when the light is very dim while cones need bright light to work. There are 20 times more rod than cone receptors in the eye.
Photoreceptors have the capacity to react to electromagnetic energy. Certain molecules can absorb photons at particular wavelengths which causes the molecule to change shape. In rods, the conversion of light into a chemical signal is accomplished through a protein called rhodopsin. Rhodopsin is a membrane protein that is localized to the disks in the outer segment of the photo receptor. It's composed of a GPCR (opsin) and its ligand (retinal). Together, they form the visual pigment rhodopsin.
Like any GPCR the binding of a ligand to the receptor activates the G proteins in the membrane, which in turn stimulates the downstream enzymatic generation of cytoplasmic second messenger molecules. It's the action of the second messenger molecules that can directly or indirectly change the conductance of ion channels with the effect of changing the neuronal membrane potential. In this case, what differentiates rhodopsins from other GPCRs is the fact that it's ligand retinal is already tightly bound to the GPCR protein backbone opsin. When a photon is absorbed by retinal, the shape of the retinal changes from 11-cis retinal to all-trans retinal. But this confirmational change in retinal also causes changes in the opsin backbone which cause activation of the G protein called transducin, which in turn leads to changes in the cytoplasmic concentration of second messenger molecules. In this case, cyclic GMP by the action of an enzyme known as cGMP phosphodiesterase, which lead to the modulation of cGMP-gated ion channels and changes in the membrane potential.
While there is only one type of rod, there are three types of cones. Short wave cones, or S cones, detect blue light, with a peak wavelength of around 420 to 440 nanometers. Middle wave cones, or M cones, detect green light, with a peak wavelength at around 535 to 550 nanometers. Long wave cones, or L cones, detect red light, with a peak wavelength of around 565 to 580 nanometers. For comparison, rod cells have a peak sensitivity at around 498 nanometers, roughly halfway between the peak sensitivity of the short and middle wave cones. The spectral sensitivity and difference in the signals received from the three cone types allows the brain to perceive a continuous range of colors. All cone receptor types contain GPCR protein called photopsin, also known as cone opsin, which is able to transduce light in a similar manner as rods through the conversion of 11-cis retinal to all-trans retinal. The color sensitivity stems from the fact that the photopsin protein differs by a few amino acids for each cone type, thus allowing light absorption at different wavelengths.

## Retinal Processing
The retina is organized in three main specialized cellular layers that are connected by two synaptic layers. The outer nuclear layer contains the photoreceptors, rods and cones. The inner nuclear layer contains interneurons, including the bipolar, horizontal and amacrine cells. And the ganglion layer contains retinal ganglion cells, which are the output neurons that generate action potentials that are transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain. Curiously, retinal ganglion cells are the only cell type in the retina capable of generating action potentials. All other cells in the retina, possibly with the sole exception of select amacrine cell types, respond to stimulation with graded changes in their membrane potential.
The receptive field is organized in a center-surround organization. For some cells a response can be recorded when the center of the receptive field is illuminated, but this response was abolished when the surround was illuminated as well. We call these cells ON center cells. Similarly, there are receptive fields with an OFF center-surround organization that work in the reciprocal way. Most retinal ganglion cells respond better to well aimed small spots of light then to diffuse light due to the fact that the center-surround organization of the receptive field enhances sensitivity to edges and contrast.
