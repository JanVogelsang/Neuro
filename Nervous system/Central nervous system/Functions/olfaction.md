# Olfaction
## Receptors
The human genome consists of about a thousand different odorant receptors, while about 30-40% of these genes are functional.
According to the shape-pattern theory, scent perception depends on the amount of structural fit between an odorant receptor's shape and the odorant's shape. Therefore, an odorant can have different smells depending on which parts of its chemical structure bind to a given odorant receptor.
In addition to the shape-pattern theory, it turns out that we can also detect the pattern of activity across variant odor receptor types, and the intensity of a given odorant also changes which receptors will be activated. the specific timing and order in which an odorant receptor is activated also influences how odors are perceived.
The olfactory system has evolved mechanisms for disentangling odors - mixtures of odorants - even when they co-activate some of the same olfactory receptors.In the case of olfaction, this is thought to rely on the turbulent movement of odorant compounds in plumes originating from the odorant source.
