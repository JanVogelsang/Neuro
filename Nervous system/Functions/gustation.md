## Tastes

The four classic axes of taste are sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Our perception of sweet signals, the presence of sugars and starches in our food, which are essential biological macromolecules that nurture us and keep us alive. The perception of salty indicates the presence of sodium and potassium ions, which, as you know, are critical for the proper functioning of our neurons. The taste of sour occurs in the presence of acids. Lastly, bases and toxins trigger the perception of bitterness, preventing us from experiencing negative physiological effects by consuming them.  
More recently, a fifth taste was added to our classic list, umami which was recognized as the scientific term for describing the effect of tasting glutamate and other amino acids often found in savory food additives.  
However, five taste modalities might not be the limit. Potential new tastes include the specific perception of gases, such as carbon dioxide or CO2, as well as select fatty acids and even water.  
While humans clearly have different taste receptor cells for each taste, all of these receptor types are distributed reasonably uniformly across the tongue.
In the surface layers of our tongue, taste receptors are assembled into taste buds, which are packed together into taste papillae. In these taste buds, specialized taste receptor cells form synapses onto gustatory nerve fibers which project deeper into the brain.  
Sour and salt are both sensed by ion channels that carry or are activated by specific ions: Sodium in the case of a salty taste and protons in the case of a sour taste. In both cases, receptor activation leads to a positive ion influx into the sensory cell and the subsequent depolarization of the cell, which, in turn, leads to the release of neurotransmitter and activation of gustatory fibers projecting to the brain. Bitter, sweet, and umami taste inducing compounds bind to G-protein coupled receptors and activate them. T1R combinations allow us to detect sweet and umami flavors. About 40 T2R receptors can detect bitter compounds.

## Perception

Experiments with transgenic mice showed that it is not the receptor that determines the taste our brain perceives, but instead it is the identity of the taste cell the receptor is embedded in. The receptor simply renders the cell sensitive to the presence of a chemical in its environment. Once the receptors activate a sensory cell, the neurobiological meaning transferred by the cell depends on its taste character.

### Insects

Butterflies and honeybees have taste receptors on their feet. Honeybees also have taste receptors on their jaws, four limbs and antennae.  
The earthworm's entire body is covered with taste receptors.
