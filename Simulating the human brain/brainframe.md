The general goal of the NCL (Neuro Computing Lab) BrainFrame research theme is to apply high-performance, innovative solutions for enabling large-scale, accurate or real-time brain simulations. Furthermore, for leveraging powerful experimental setups or data analysis for amplifying brain research. Thus, our activities employ a multitude of HPC and other acceleration technologies such as FPGAs, Dataflow Computing Engines, GPUs and Many-core processors and most recently Cloud computing.

## Framework

### TYPE-I

Simulation of highly accurate models (biophysically accurate and even accurate to the molecular level) of smaller-sized networks (100-1000 neurons) that require close to real-time performance.

### TYPE-II

The second type involves the simulation of large--scale networks in which accuracy can often be relaxed.  These experiments attempt to simulate network sizes and connection densities closely resembling their biological counterparts (over 1000 neurons).
