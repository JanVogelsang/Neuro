What happens to the brain if it gets access to completely new streams of information? Will it be able to handle it, will it intervene with regular vision, are there conflicts or can both regular and enhanced vision coexist. How could adaption of enhanced vision systems be supported, might there be a way to slowly integrate the EVSs into the brain?
