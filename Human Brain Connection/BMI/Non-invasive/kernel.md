# Kernel
## Goal
"At Kernel, our primary goal is to enable improved and accelerated insights into the human brain", by providing Neuroscience as a Service (NaaS) serving online neuroscience studies.  
"Two key factors restricting progress towards understanding the brain":  
1. "Acquiring the best brain signals today requires expensive, complex, and room-sized equipment with the need for full-time, trained technicians. The cost and sheer size of these machines, in addition to the restrictions placed on user movement and experimental environments, limit their scale and potential."  
    -> "Hardware for brain signal acquisition that is low-cost, scalable, easy to use, and that supports natural environments and motion"  
2. "The complexities and diverse requirements for measuring and interpreting neural signals which [...] require input and expertise from a wide array of disciplines[,] including fundamental sensor physics, hardware design, firmware development, experimental design, signal processing, machine learning, and neuroscience."  
    -> Putting expertise in all required areas under one roof  

## Experiments
### 1. Speller
Decoding gaze from brain signals to get the tiles consisting of 26 letters and 10 digits the subjects were looking at.  


### 2. Sound ID
